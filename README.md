# PacMen
Renders any number of PacMen onto the screen and allows them to roam the browser window

## Usage
The 'Add PacMan' button will, unsurprisingly, add a new PacMan with a randomly assigned position and velocity to the game element. The 'Start Game' button will initialize movement for all PacMen, and pressing the start button again will speed up the PacMen

## Future Updates
The next thing I will be adding to this page is an array of food for the PacMen to consume, and possibly Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde
